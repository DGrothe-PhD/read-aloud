# read-aloud

This is a rudimentary attempt to create a simple PDF reader using free and open source components. An by reader I mean reading aloud using text-to-speech.

Download `main.py`, place a pdf next to it, and run `main.py`. The terminal will ask you five questions about the voice and speed preference, the path and the filename, and whether you want to continue on a specific page. You can just hit enter to each prompt to choose the defaults (will choose first pdf alphabetically in the current folder). I have no way of pausing or stopping the reader at the moment, stay tuned.
